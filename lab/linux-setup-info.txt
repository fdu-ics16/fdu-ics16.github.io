There are basically two ways for a typical Windows user to get access to a Linux system:
  1. Install a dual Linux system alongside with your Windows system. Please search on Google/Bing for further information.
  2. Use visual machine software to setup a Linux system inside your Windows. Again, Google is your friend.

Since most Linux distribution is available online for free, we did not provide any ISO file on the course website for the sake of storage limitation.
In case of specific Linux distribution, we recommend Ubuntu 16.*. It is a stable and, most importantly, widely used distribution.
The most commonly used visual machine software is VMware which, unfortunately, is not for free. Thus we can not provide it neither.
However, if you know how to download file using Fudan PT, you can get both VMware and Ubuntu 16.* from there, you bet, for free!

Of course, you are welcomed to come to me(oucz14@fudan.edu.cn) to get help. I can provide a decent Linux setup using dual system way.
